   This is the OSGi Blueprint XML file defining the Camel context and routes.  

   Because the file is in the OSGI-INF/blueprint directory inside our JAR, it 
   will be automatically activated as soon as the bundle is installed.

   The root element for any OSGi Blueprint file is 'blueprint' - you also see 
   the namespace definitions for both the Blueprint and the Camel namespaces.

        The namespace for the camelContext element in Blueprint is 'http://camel.apache.org/schema/blueprint'. 
        Additionally,  we can also define namespace prefixes we want to use them 
        in the XPath expressions in our CBR.

        While it is not required to assign id's to the <camelContext/> and <route/> 
        elements, it is a good idea to set those for runtime management purposes 
        (logging, JMX MBeans, ...)
